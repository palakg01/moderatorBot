# moderatorBot
This is a simple discord bot that can be used to moderate discord servers for toxicity detection. 

### How it works
* It uses the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) module and [tensorflow toxicity model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/toxicity). 
* It classifies the message as toxic or non-toxic based on a particular threshold value. Any message that crosses the toxicity threshold value is auto-deleted by the bot.
### You can invite the bot to your server by using the following link
